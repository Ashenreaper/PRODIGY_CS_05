Network Packet Analyzer

👁️‍🗨️ Network Detective: Your Insight into the Digital Flow 👁️‍🗨️

This Python script acts as a network packet analyzer, allowing you to capture
and dissect network traffic passing through your network interface. It provides
a clear view of the communication happening behind the scenes, displaying
essential information such as source and destination IP addresses, the
protocols being used, and a glimpse into the data being transmitted.

Use this tool responsibly and ethically for educational purposes, network
troubleshooting, and understanding network behavior. Capturing and analyzing
traffic on networks you do not own or have permission to access is illegal and unethical.

Key Features:
  - Captures packets in real-time.
  - Displays source and destination IP addresses.
  - Identifies the network protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
  - Shows a hexadecimal representation of the packet payload.
  - Provides a basic decoding of common protocols.

Please note: Running this script might require administrator/root privileges
depending on your operating system and the network interface you choose.

Dependencies:
  - scapy (install using: pip install scapy)
